<h1> Wipro Technical Question And Answer</h1>
<p>
    <h4>Frontend Questions</h4>
    <h4>1. What is the difference between React and Angular?</h4>
    Answer:
    
    <h5>Feature React Angular</h5>
    <h5>Type</h5>	Library	Framework
    <h5>Language</h5>	JavaScript	TypeScript
    <h5>Data Binding</h5>	One-way	Two-way
    <h5>Performance </h5>	Fast (Virtual DOM)	Slightly slower (Real DOM)
    <h5>Learning </h5>Curve	Easier	Steeper 
    
    <h4>2. Explain the Virtual DOM in React.</h4>
    Answer:
    Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the Real DOM.
    React uses diffing and reconciliation to update only the changed parts of the DOM, improving performance.
    Example:
    User interacts with a React component.
    React updates the Virtual DOM instead of the actual DOM.
    It compares (diffs) the new Virtual DOM with the previous version.
    Only the changed elements get updated in the Real DOM.
    
    <h4>3. What is the difference between Local Storage, Session Storage, and Cookies?</h4>
    Answer:
    <h5>Feature	Local Storage	Session Storage	Cookies</h5>
    <h5>Storage Limit</h5>	5MB	5MB	4KB
    <h5>Expiry</h5>	Never (unless manually cleared)	Cleared when session ends	Can have expiry time
    <h5>Accessible By</h5>	Same-origin JavaScript	Same-origin JavaScript	Sent with HTTP requests
   <h5>> Use Case</h5>	Store user preferences	Temporary data during session	Authentication tokens
    
    Backend Questions
    <h4>4. Explain the difference between REST and GraphQL.</h4>
    Answer:
    Feature	REST	GraphQL
    Data Fetching	Fixed endpoints (/users, /posts)	Single endpoint (/graphql)
    Over-fetching	Yes, gets extra data	No, fetches only required fields
    Under-fetching	Yes, may need multiple requests	No, gets everything in one request
    Performance	Can be slower (multiple requests)	Faster (single request)
    
    <h4>5. What is Middleware in Express.js?</h4>
    Answer:
    	Middleware is a function that executes before reaching the final request handler in Express.js.
    	Used for authentication, logging, error handling, and modifying requests.
    Example:
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    
    // Middleware function
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
      console.log('Request received');
      next(); // Pass control to next middleware
    });
    
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello, World!');
    });
    
    app.listen(3000);
    
    <h4>6. Explain JWT Authentication in Node.js.</h4>
    Answer:
    JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for secure user authentication.
    	User logs in with credentials.
    	Server creates a JWT token and sends it to the user.
    	User sends JWT in Authorization header for subsequent requests.
    	Server validates JWT before granting access.
    Example in Node.js:
    const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
    
    const token = jwt.sign({ userId: 123 }, 'secretkey', { expiresIn: '1h' });
    
    console.log(token);
    
    <h4>Database Questions</h4>

    <h4>7. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?</h4>
    Answer:
    Feature	SQL	NoSQL
    Schema	Fixed Schema	Flexible Schema
    Data Storage	Tables (Rows & Columns)	Key-Value, Document, Graph
    Scalability	Vertical Scaling	Horizontal Scaling
    Examples	MySQL, PostgreSQL	MongoDB, Cassandra
    
    <h4>8. How do you perform Pagination in MongoDB?</h4>
    Answer:
    Pagination helps fetch limited results in large datasets.
    Example using skip() and limit():
    db.users.find().skip(10).limit(5);
    	skip(10) → Skips first 10 records.
    	limit(5) → Fetches next 5 records.
    
    <h4>9. What is Indexing in Databases?</h4>
    Answer:
    Indexing improves the speed of data retrieval.
    Example in MySQL:
    CREATE INDEX idx_user ON users(name);
    Creates an index on the "name" column for faster searches.
    
    <h4>DevOps & Cloud Questions</h4>
    
    <h4>10. What is Docker, and why is it used?</h4>
    Answer:
    	Docker is a containerization tool that packages applications with dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments.
    	Benefits: 
    	Lightweight compared to Virtual Machines
    	Portable across different OS
    	Faster deployment
    
   <h4> 11. What is the difference between Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment?</h4>
    Answer:
    Feature	CI (Continuous Integration)	CD (Continuous Deployment)
    Definition	Automates code testing and merging	Automates full deployment to production
    Trigger	Every code commit	Every successful test
    Example Tool	Jenkins, GitHub Actions	AWS CodeDeploy, Kubernetes
    
    <h4>12. How do you deploy a Node.js app using Docker?</h4>
    Answer:
    1.	Create a Dockerfile
    FROM node:14
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY package.json .
    RUN npm install
    COPY . .
    CMD ["node", "server.js"]
    EXPOSE 3000
    2.	Build and Run the Container
    docker build -t myapp .
    docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp
    
    System Design Questions
    <h4>13. How would you design a URL Shortener like Bit.ly?</h4>
    Answer:
    Key Components:
    •	Frontend: React.js for UI
    •	Backend: Node.js with Express
    •	Database: NoSQL (MongoDB) for fast lookups
    •	Algorithm: Base62 Encoding (abc123)
    •	Caching: Redis for quick access
    
    14. <h4>How would you scale a high-traffic e-commerce website?</h4>
    Answer:
    1.	Load Balancer – Distribute traffic across multiple servers.
    2.	CDN (Content Delivery Network) – Cache images & static files.
    3.	Database Sharding – Split database for faster queries.
    4.	Microservices – Separate cart, payments, and user services.
    5.	Caching (Redis/Memcached) – Store frequently accessed data.
    
    <h4>15. How do you handle security in Full-Stack Applications?</h4>
    Answer:
    1.	Authentication – Use JWT, OAuth, or session-based auth.
    2.	SQL Injection Prevention – Use parameterized queries.
    3.	XSS Prevention – Sanitize user inputs.
    4.	CORS Handling – Restrict cross-origin access.
    5.	HTTPS – Encrypt data using SSL/TLS.
