    Answer:
    SDLC is the process of developing software in structured phases:
    	Requirement Analysis – Understanding client needs
    	Planning – Estimating resources & time
    	Design – Architecture & UI/UX design
    	Development – Writing code
    	Testing – Debugging & Quality Assurance

    <h4>3. What is the difference between a Compiler and an Interpreter?</h4>
    Answer:
    Feature	Compiler	Interpreter
    Execution	Translates whole code before execution	Translates & runs line-by-line
    Speed	Faster	Slower
    Example Languages	C, C++	Python, JavaScript
    
    <h4>4. What are Joins in SQL?</h4>
    Answer:
    Joins combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
    Types of Joins:
    	INNER JOIN – Returns matching rows from both tables.
    	LEFT JOIN – Returns all rows from the left table, matching rows from the right.
    	RIGHT JOIN – Returns all rows from the right table, matching rows from the left.
    	FULL JOIN – Returns all rows from both tables.
    
    <h4>5. What is a Cloud Computing and its Service Models?</h4>
    Answer:
    Cloud computing delivers computing services over the internet.
    Service Models:
    	IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) – Virtual machines, storage (e.g., AWS EC2).
    	PaaS (Platform as a Service) – Development environments (e.g., Google App Engine).
    	SaaS (Software as a Service) – Software applications (e.g., Gmail, Office 365).
    
    <h4>6. What is the difference between an Abstract Class and an Interface in Java?</h4>
    Answer:
    Feature	Abstract Class	Interface
    Method Implementation	Can have both abstract & concrete methods	Only abstract methods (before Java 8)
    Multiple Inheritance	Not supported	Supported
    Use Case	Used for base class functionality	Used for defining contract behavior
    
    <h4>7. What is the difference between DELETE, DROP, and TRUNCATE in SQL?</h4>
    Answer:
    	DELETE – Removes specific rows but keeps structure & logs transactions.
    	TRUNCATE – Removes all rows, keeps structure, faster than DELETE.
    	DROP – Removes the entire table including structure.
    
    <h4>8. What is a Deadlock in a Database?</h4>
    Answer:
    A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions hold resources the other needs, leading to an indefinite wait.
    Prevention Techniques:
    	Use timeout mechanisms
    	Apply lock ordering
    	Avoid circular wait conditions
    
    <h4>9. What is the difference between a Microservices and Monolithic Architecture?</h4>
    Answer:
    Feature	Monolithic	Microservices
    Structure	Single codebase	Multiple independent services
    Scalability	Harder to scale	Easily scalable
    Development Speed	Slower	Faster
    Technology Flexibility	Limited	Uses different tech stacks
    
    <h4>10. Explain the Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS.</h4>
    Answer:
    Feature	HTTP	HTTPS
    Security	Not secure	Secure (SSL/TLS encryption)
    Port	Uses port 80	Uses port 443
    Usage	Data transfer	Secure transactions
    
    <h4>11. What is the difference between Process and Thread?</h4>
    Answer:
    Feature	Process	Thread
    Definition	Independent executing program	Subset of a process
    Memory Usage	Uses more memory	Uses less memory
    Communication	Slower (Inter-Process Communication)	Faster (Shared memory)
    Example	Running multiple applications	Multi-threaded programs (Java, Python)
    
    <h4>12. What is Docker?</h4>
    Answer:
    Docker is a containerization tool that allows developers to package applications with dependencies and run them in isolated environments.
    Benefits:
    	Lightweight (compared to Virtual Machines)
    	Portable across different systems
    	Scalable for cloud deployment
    
    <h4>13. What is REST API?</h4>
    Answer:
    REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
    Key principles:
    	Stateless – Each request is independent.
    	Client-Server – Separation between frontend and backend.
    	CRUD Operations – Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
    Example:
    GET /users → Fetch all users  
    POST /users → Create a new user  
    PUT /users/1 → Update user with ID 1  
    DELETE /users/1 → Delete user with ID 1  
    
    <h4>14. What is Machine Learning?</h4>
    Answer:
    Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions.
    Types of ML:
    	Supervised Learning – Uses labeled data (e.g., Spam Detection).
    	Unsupervised Learning – Finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., Clustering).
    	Reinforcement Learning – Learns by trial & error (e.g., Self-driving cars).
   
    <h4>15. What is the difference between Static and Dynamic Testing?</h4>
    Answer:
    Feature	Static Testing	Dynamic Testing
    Execution	No code execution	Requires code execution
    Examples	Code review, walkthroughs	Unit testing, functional testing
    When Used	Early stage	After code implementation
    
    <h4>16. What is the difference between Black Box and White Box Testing?</h4>
    Answer:
    	Black Box Testing: Tests functionality without knowing the internal code.
    	White Box Testing: Tests internal code logic and structure.
    Example:
    	Black Box: Checking login functionality.
    	White Box: Checking if an if condition works correctly in the code.
