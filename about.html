<h1>TCS Technical Question And Answer</h1>
<p>
    <h4>1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? Explain its principles.</h4>
    Answer:
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on objects that encapsulate data and behavior. The main principles of OOP are:
    Encapsulation: Hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary parts.
    Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.
    Inheritance: Allowing a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class.
    Polymorphism: Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class while calling different methods.
    
    <h4>2. What is the difference between C and C++?</h4>
    Answer:
    Feature	C	C++
    Paradigm	Procedural	Object-Oriented + Procedural
    Encapsulation	Not Supported	Supported
    Inheritance	Not Supported	Supported
    Function Overloading	Not Supported	Supported
    Data Security	Less secure (Global variables)	More secure (Encapsulation)
    
    <h4>3. What is the difference between Stack and Queue?</h4>
    Answer:
    Stack: Follows LIFO (Last In, First Out). Example: Undo/Redo operations.
    Queue: Follows FIFO (First In, First Out). Example: Print queue in printers.
    
    <h4>4. What is Normalization in DBMS?</h4>
    Answer:
    Normalization is a process to remove redundancy and dependency by organizing fields and table relationships. The normal forms are:
    1NF - Eliminates duplicate columns.
    2NF - Ensures all non-key attributes depend on the primary key.
    3NF - Removes transitive dependencies.
    BCNF- A stricter version of 3NF.
    
    <h4>5. Explain the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases.</h4>
    Answer:
    Feature	SQL	NoSQL
    Schema	Fixed Schema	Flexible Schema
    Scalability	Vertical Scaling	Horizontal Scaling
    Data Storage	Tables (Rows & Columns)	Key-Value, Document, Graph
    Examples	MySQL, PostgreSQL	MongoDB, Cassandra
    
    <h4>6. What is the difference between Primary Key and Foreign Key?</h4>
    Answer:
    Primary Key: Uniquely identifies a record in a table.
    Foreign Key: Refers to a primary key in another table to establish relationships.
    
    <h4>7. What is an Operating System? What are its functions?</h4>
    Answer:
    An Operating System (OS) is software that manages computer hardware and software resources.
    Functions:
    
    Process management
    Memory management
    File system management
    Device management
    Security & access control
    
    <h4>8. What is the difference between GET and POST methods in HTTP?</h4>
    Answer:
    Feature	GET	POST
    Usage	Retrieve Data	Send Data
    Data Visibility	Visible in URL	Hidden in the request body
    Security	Less secure	More secure
    Caching	Cached	Not cached
    
    <h4>9. What is a Deadlock in OS? How can it be prevented?</h4>
    Answer:
    A Deadlock occurs when two or more processes block each other by holding resources the other needs.
    Prevention Techniques:
    Avoid circular wait
    Implement timeout-based resource allocation
    Use a resource hierarchy
    
    <h4>10. What is Agile methodology?</h4>
    Answer:
    Agile is a software development approach based on iterative progress. It promotes:
    
    Continuous feedback
    Adaptive planning
    Collaboration
    Frequent delivery
    Example: Scrum and Kanban frameworks</p>
